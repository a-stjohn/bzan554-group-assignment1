Question: Meet with you team to discuss the details of how you are going to
approach the group assignment. Write pseudo code for every single step in your
code. The more details you provide the higher the chance of getting credit for
this bonus assignment.

#Answer:

1. Communicate with group that the best collaboration and version control tool
we can use is Github. Thus, create and poupulate the Github repo with
Aaron S. as the owner.

2. Download the zipped data (unzip too large).

3. Read the data in and output 10 rows with the title and category of the
product. Code to do this has been provided in the assignment. This is done
using a generator because the data is too large to load into RAM.
