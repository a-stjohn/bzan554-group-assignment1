Step 1) 
Create a github repository for us to collaborate in. We will invite everyone as a collaborator
onto the project, and this is where we will create branches and merge code as neccessary. For this
project we have elected Aaron S. to be the repo owner since he has the most experience with
GitHub.

Step 2) 
Download the zipped data (unzip too large).

Step 3) 
Read the data in and output 10 rows with the title and category of the
product. Code to do this has been provided in the assignment. This is done
using a generator because the data is too large to load into RAM.

Step 4)
Generate the rough architecture for the CNN. This includes figuring out
the number of input nodes, the number of hidden layers, as well as the number of hidden
nodes per layer. This step will probably be revisted multiple times throughout the project.

Step 5)
Iteratively step through some of the data, perhaps the first 10% (or a flat number like
10k) and evaluate the performance of the model to make sure everything is working and that
we are getting the results we expect.

Step 6)
Based on the output of step 5 we may need to reiterate up to step 4 to reshape the architecture of
the CNN. Once we are pleased with the results of our trial run we move on to step 6.

Step 7) 
Once we have settled on the architecture for our Neural Network, we will train the 
model on all of the data and gauge it's performance. 

Step 8) 
Once we evaluate the performance of the model we can decide if we want to bake in some form
of cleaning for the 'other' category to help the model learning. If we decide the model is performing
well enough then we can conclude the project.

Step 9) 
Create the write-up for the assignment. This includes a presentation talking about the performance
of the model, the insights we garnered from the model, as well as details on the data, training times
and the like. 

Step 10)
Submit the project and feel good about a job well done.
